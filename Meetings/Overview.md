## PREPARATION AND MATERIALS NEEDED

Use this section of the den meeting plan to determine the materials you will need to lead the den meeting and to know when to make arrangements in advance, such as scheduling a meeting with a guest or arranging the logistics for an outing.
Read the pages in the youth handbook for each new adventure before you start to work on it. The handbook provides background information, instructions, or suggestions for many activities. Encourage Scouts to bring their handbooks to each meeting.

## GATHERING (5 TO 15 MINUTES BEFORE MEETING)

• Welcoming activities for early arrivals while they wait for the meeting to start
• Suggested gathering activities range from active games to quiet pastimes, depending on children’s needs (energy release or settling down), time of day, and the meeting venue
• Should not include activities essential to the meeting, as not everyone will be part of the gathering experience
Use a formal, time-consuming gathering activity only if youth arrive at different times and there is considerable time before everyone is present. Be sure to begin the meeting itself on time. Sometimes a nutritious snack is substituted for a gathering activity. The gathering activity sets the tone for the den meeting.

## OPENING (5+ MINUTES)

• Pledge of Allegiance (may be part of larger flag ceremony)
• Recite the Scout Oath and Law together
• Sometimes additional inspiring message or reflection
• May include Outdoor Code or Leave No Trace ideas related to preparation for an outing
Youth and adults stand respectfully for the opening, which often takes place with Scouts in a horseshoe or circle at the front of the room. The opening may be a longer ceremony for special occasions.

## TALK TIME (5+ MINUTES)

• Overview of meeting and den member roles (what to expect)
• Dues collection (only if needed and not collected otherwise)
• General announcements and updates
• Quick discussion (or extensive planning) for coming events
• May include youth sharing ideas or accomplishments related to adventure requirements
• May introduce a new adventure or set groundwork for future advancement
Expand the meeting time to accommodate in-depth discussion or planning if needed.

## ACTIVITIES (30+ MINUTES)

• The heart, or core, of the den meeting, where most of the fun and learning (adventure requirements) take place
• Two to three projects, games, or discussions chosen from requirement activities in the meeting plan
Note that many of the activities for requirements include a reflection at the end. (See “Closing” below.) Make sure that someone is taking notes on parts of requirements each youth completes.

## CLOSING (5+ MINUTES)

• A ceremonial moment wrapping up the meeting
• Often led by the denner, the youth leader of the den
Closing should be a quiet time. It usually works best to have youth stand in a circle or horseshoe with adults standing behind.

## AFTER THE MEETING

• Assign roles and provide opportunities for teamwork.
• Ensure protocols in place for continued supervision and parental pickup.
• Review the general success of the meeting, such as group dynamics and accomplishments.
• Record Scouts’ individual requirement completions in their advancement reports, either on paper or electronically.
• Plan for following up with additional parts of requirements or to make arrangements for coming events.
• Communicate with parents via email or a note given to the child to take home. Include a review of the Scouts’ accomplishments and reminders of future events and arrangements.
