## About Cub Scout Pack 3943

### Pack 3943’s Mission

Pack 3943 is an organization that engages our community’s young boys and girls and their families with fun, interactive, educational activities and exposes them to a variety of experiences. These activities are planned and delivered through fully trained, resourceful and responsible leaders and focus on basic values that help prepare young people to make exceptional choices over their lifetime.

### Background

Pack 3943’s mission supports the overarching MISSION of Scout’s America:
To prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law.

### The Scout Oath

On my honor I will do my best
To do my duty to God and my country
And to obey the Scout Law;
To help other people at all times;
To keep myself physically strong,
mentally awake, and morally straight.

### The Scout Law

obedient,
cheerful,
thrifty,
brave,
clean,
and reverent.

Cub Scout Moto:
“Do your best.”

One of the key concepts in the Cub Scouting is that the Pack helps the Cub Scout grow, but the Pack can only do that if it is growing as well. Growth, in the case of the Pack, is not limited to membership but also growth with regard to what we have to offer our Scouts.

In our current culture there are many demands on families that cause them to have to carefully choose how they are spending their time and resources. Those demands include, but are not limited to: sports and other extracurricular activities; work; academics; budgetary; and social interests. In order to attract and retain Cub Scouts, we must provide something of value to them.

Parent Participation
Every Parent, Caregiver (Akela) is required to volunteer in some capacity every year. A system for communicating and tracking volunteer needs/requirements should be developed and maintained. For those who are unable to volunteer, a alternative option may be provided, i.e., providing supplies and/or additional resources.

Pack Location
Pack 3943 is chartered by the Hillsdale PTO. We generally hold our Pack Meetings in the Hillsdale Elementary School Gymnasium (725 West Market Street, West Chester, PA) on the third Friday of every month throught the school year. Some exceptions to meeting dates and locations are made depending on our Pack Meeting program and other school events.  Meeting date and location will be noted on the Pack Calendar and in the News & Events section of this website.
